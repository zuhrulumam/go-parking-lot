# Interview Test Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the interview test. I have provided two different approaches:

1. **Simple Solution** – A minimal and straightforward implementation.
2. **Long Solution** – A more elaborate and extended version, showcasing additional considerations and improvements.

## How to Navigate

Each solution is organized in its own folder:

- [`doit-test-simple/`](./doit-test-simple/) – Basic version with essential functionality.
- [`doit-test-long/`](./doit-test-long/) – More comprehensive version with extended features or structure.

Please refer to the individual `README.md` files inside each folder for details about the implementation, setup, and usage instructions.
